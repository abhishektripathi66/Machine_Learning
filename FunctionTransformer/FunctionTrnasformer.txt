Function Transformer is used for converting data of any column if its in non normal distribution to normal distribution

we use many functions to do so, some times if scaling dont bring down the values then we use logarithmic functions
some times we need to change pattern then we van use functional transform like coverting from cm to m and Kelvin to degree celcius
