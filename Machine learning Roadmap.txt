First go through the Machine learning Roadmap,...pdf file
then go to the missing values folder check how to add the missing values
next go to encoding basically how we would be ecoding the categorical data into the numerical format 
then look into what outliers are and how we would be dealing with it.
post that go through the Feature Scaling
after the feature scaling is performed have a look on how we are handling the duplicate data
then we have to replace and change the data type as per the requirement
Now we should be performing the Funciton Trnasformer
