if we have the limited data available then we take some part of the dataset for training and another part of the dataset for testing
if the model accuracy is not good then we retrain the model

if we add the complete data to train and test with same data itll mostly give 100% accuracy
coz it memorizes or trains on that, so to check if its capable of handling new data we use different data for test and train

so we would use like 70-80% of train data and then have 20-30% data for test which was unseen by the model, to check its accuracy
if the accuracy is not up to the mark we would retrain the model

This splitting is done only for the Supervised learning and not unsupervised learning
and we have the data into independent and dependent format,
we have to find out the independent and dependent data and split them
