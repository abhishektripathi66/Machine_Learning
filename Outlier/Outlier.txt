if any data that goes beyond a range then that is called outlier data as that data is not in the set range

if our data follows any normal distribution pattern and if the tail goes beyond the normal distribution then thats called  outlier data
the data that is outside the viscor plot is considered as outlier data
these outlier data create a noise in all the outcomes.

if my data is within range of 5 and 6, but we got a data thats 13 so it creates alot of nice
and this gives wrong output

first we will identify the outlier data and then remove it so we have a prcise or best output.
All the mean, median avg will change coz of the outlier
